# Useful programs - Maybe not that useful...

## areavol.hpprgm 

Calculate the surface area of a 3D figure, like a rectangle, triangular prism, cylinder, cone or sphere


## vol.hpprgm 

Calculate the volume of a rectangle, triangular prism, cylinder, cone or sphere


## fseries.hpprgm 

Calculate the Fourier's coeficients for Fourier's Trigonometric, Exponential or Harmonic series.
Attention: when you enter the expression, please use t as your variable. For example, if your expression is *f(t) = 2t* , then enter 2*t

* ftrig(expression, period, initial k value, final k value) -> Return the calculated a and b coeficients for every k value
* fexp(expression, period, initial k value, final k value) -> Return the calculated c coeficient and θ for every k value
* fhar(expression, period, initial k value, final k value) -> Return the calculated c coeficient and θ for every k value
* fcoefa(expression, period) -> Return the function to calculate the coeficient a (Only used in trig. series)
* fcoefb(expression, period) -> Return the function to calculate the coeficient b (Only used in trig. series)
* fcoefc(expression, period) -> Return the function to calculate the coeficient c (Only used in exp. series)

Attention: this program has some bugs and may not work for every function or value.
